Description: libcmime - A C mime library
 libcmime is a lightweight mime library, written in C. It attempts to be a 
 general library for parsing and creating mime email messages and is 
 designed to provide an easy to use and easy to integrate interface for 
 developers. libcmime is a pretty fresh project so the library is still in 
 beta state and there will be early and frequent releases.
