Installation Instructions
*************************

Basic Installation
===================

libcmime uses cmake instead of the autotools "configure" script. CMake normally 
uses a separate build directory - follow these steps to configure, build and 
install this package from source:

tar xvfz libcmime-<VERSION>.tar.gz
cd libcmime-<VERSION>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ <configure parameters>
make
make install


Configure Parameters
=====================

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
`cmake' script does not know about.  Run `./cmake -h' for details on some of
the pertinent environment variables.

You can give `cmake' initial values for configuration parameters by setting 
variables in the command line or in the environment. Here is an example:

	./cmake ../ -DPREFIX:STRING=/usr/local

Instead of defining parameters on the command line you can also create 
the file "build.properties" in the source and define your configuration
parameters there. Here is an example for "build.properties":


	set(PREFIX /usr/local)
	set(ENABLE_DEBUG TRUE)


Installation Names
==================

By default, 'make install' installs the library under '/usr/local/lib' and the 
include files under '/usr/local/include'.
