@mainpage Overview
 
@section about What is libcmime?
libcmime is a lightweight mime library, written in C.  It attempts to be a general library for parsing and creating mime email messages and is designed to provide an easy to use and easy to integrate interface for developers. libcmime is a pretty fresh
project so the library is still in beta state and there will be early and frequent releases. 


@section download Getting libcmime

You can download the sources at http://libcmime.org/files
Development is done using <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/" target="_blank">Mercurial</a>
@code
$ hg clone https://hg.libcmime.org/
@endcode


@section reqiorements System requirements
For proper compilation and functionality of libcmime, the following packages are REQUIRED:
- cmake >= 2.6 (http://www.cmake.org/)
- Flex >= 2.5.33 (http://flex.sourceforge.net/)
- Bison >= 1.8 (http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)

@section install Install from source
libcmime uses cmake instead of the autotools "configure" script. Cmake normally uses a separate build directory - follow these steps to configure, build and install this package from source:

@code 
tar xvfz libcmime-<VERSION>.tar.gz
cd libcmime-<VERSION>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ <configure parameters>
make
make install
@endcode

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the 'cmake' script does not know 
about. Run './cmake -h' for details on some of the pertinent environment variables. You can give 'cmake'
initial values for configuration parameters by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.
Here is an example:
@code
./cmake ../ -DPREFIX:STRING=/usr/local
@endcode

Instead of defining parameters on the command line you can also create a "build.properties"-file in the source of libcmime and define your configuration parameters there. Here is an example for a "build.properties"-file:

@code
set(PREFIX /opt)
set(ENABLE_DEBUG TRUE)
@endcode

By default, 'make install' installs the library under '/usr/local/lib' and the include files under 
'/usr/local/include'.  

@section lists Mailing lists
The developers mailing list (http://groups.google.com/group/libcmime-devel) is used for discussions 
and questions about development with libcmime.

@section license License
libcmime is released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.txt" target="_blank">LGPL</a>. This means (in short..) that you are free to use, change and distribute it.
